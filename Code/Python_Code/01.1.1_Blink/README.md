0) Organise my files so I pull from a another testfile
i) How do I test the code, so I dont have to push it to the pi? print statments?

1) Can I set up more than one LED and them alternate firing blue, red, blue..

031221:

Making a modified Blink2_mod.py to flash at different times.

Would be cool if I could ask for a string indicating a flashing order (a sequence of numbers for it to flash to e.g "1123") i want to produce then for it to do so.

Level 1: 

If i sent "1123", (with a fixed pause length say 0.5 secs) it could blink 1 pause, 1 pause, blink 2 pause, then 3 times.

Level 2: Done
Given a word, "bat" would output the morse code for it.

Need: dictionary of morse code for letters. e.g "100" for pause, dot,dot.
